# Bitcoin Development Opportunities

Christian Decker told Justin at MIT Bitcoin conference that he would like help with [his integration testing framework](https://github.com/cdecker/lightning-integration). The goal of this project is to test that different Lightning implementations behave the same. It's a nice opportunity because Christian Decker will review your code and it's written in simple Python. Pretty understandable IMO.

Unchained Capital realeased some simple Python code to sign multisig transactions from Trezors and Ledgers: https://github.com/unchained-capital/bitcoin-multisig

[Riemann](https://github.com/summa-tx/riemann) is a slick Python library for constructing Bitcoin transactions with a friendly maintainer in James Prestwich.
